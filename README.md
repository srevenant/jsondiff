# Json Diff

> Syntax: jdiff file1.json file2.json

Compares two json files, using 'colordiff' or 'diff' (whichever is available on your system).

It sorts the keys and reformats them, so you can provide the json files in any format as long as the parser can read then,

Uses python3

Will eventually make it a pip3 installable option.
